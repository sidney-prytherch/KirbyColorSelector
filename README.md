This project allows you to create a custom color set for kirby/gooey for use in Archipelago's randomizer for KDL3.

Select your colors and copy the text on the right side and paste it in your yaml file. Be sure to set the option for color set to custom.

You can use the site here: [Kirby Color Selector Site](https://sidney-prytherch.github.io/KirbyColorSelector/)
To run offline/local, simply download the code and open index.html in a browser

If you run into any issues, want me to update something, or you find that the site is outdated in some way, feel free to send an email to me at sidneyprytherch@gmail.com

Thanks! :)
